Basic Search Techniques

Tree-Based Search: search within hierarchical structures like trees 
    Binary Search Tree
    AVL Tree Search
    Trie Search
    A Search* Heuristic-based search for shortest paths

Graph Search Algorithms:
    BFS
    DFS
    Dijkstra's
    Bellman-Ford
    Floyd-Warshall

Pattern Matching and Text Search: Search for a pattern in a text| Find all occurrences of a substring | check if one string is a rotation of another
    Naive String Search
    Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)
    Rabin-Karp
    Aho-Corasick
    Suffix Array/Trie Search


Optimization Search Problems: search for best solution in a constrained space
    Binary Search on Answer: Applies binary search to optimize a result (finding min largest sum in a split array)
    Branch and Bound: TSP
    Simulated Annealing:
    Gradient Descent: used for optimization in continuous spaces

Dynamic Programming-Based Search: searching for solutions using overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure
    Search for the longest common subsequence
    Search for the shortest path in a grid (minimizing cost)
    Matrix Chain Multiplication

Spatial Search:
    k-D Trees: for nearest neighbor search in 2D/3D space
    Quadtrees/Octrees:
    R-Trees: used for spatial indexing (GIS systems)
    Nearest Neighbor Search:

Search in Rotated/Modified Data
    Rotated sorted array
    peak element in bitonic array
    median in unsorted arrays
    Sparse Search:

Probabilistic Search: searches that involve uncertainty or probabilistic outcomes 
    Monte Carlo Search
    Simulated Annealing
    Markov Chains 

Search in 2D Grids or Matrices: searching for values or paths in two-dimensional structures
    Search for value in 2D matrix
    find all paths from top-left to bottom-right of a grid
    search for the longest connected component in a grid (island counting)

Range Search: searching for all values within a given range
    find all elements in a range in a sorted array
    search for points within a rectangular range in 2D space (Range Trees, KD-Trees)
    Special Techniques: Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees
