Binary Tree problems can be categorized into various subsections based on the type of problem and techniques required to solve them.
1. Traversal:
2. Properties:
    calculate diameter (longest path between two nodes )
   count total number of nodes or leaves 
   check if tree is balanced 
   find the size of the largest subtree
3. Modification: 
   insert a node
   delete a node
   convert a binary tree to a doubly linked list
   mirror or invert
4. Searching and Validation:
   search for a value in a BST
   check if tree is BST
   find the Lowest Common Ancestor of two nodes
   check if two trees are identical
5. Path Problems:
   find path from the root to a given node
   find all root to leaf paths
   find max or min path sum
   check if there exists a path with a given sum (Path Sum problems)
6. Subtree Problems:
7. Binary Tree Views:
8. Boundary and Perimeter Problems:
9. Transformations and Conversions: 
   serialize and deserialize a binary tree
   convert a binary tree to a BST
   flatten a binary tree to a linked list
10. Special Trees:
11. Optimization Problems:
    find max width of a binary tree
    minimize the height of a binary tree with given constraints 
    optimize tree traversal for specific conditions 
12. Advanced Problems:
    Construct a binary tree from inorder and preorder traversal
    recover a BST where two nodes are swapped 
    find nodes at a given distance from a target node (Burning Tree)
